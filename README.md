# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** (likelihood of customers leaving a service) using machine learning models. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, the models help businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify churn patterns  
- Implemented multiple supervised ML models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Performance evaluation using:  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - ROC-AUC curve
