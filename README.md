# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** (whether a customer is likely to leave a service) using machine learning techniques.  
The aim is to analyze customer data, identify patterns that contribute to churn, and build predictive models to help businesses take proactive actions.

## 🚀 Features  
- Data preprocessing & cleaning (handling nulls, encoding categorical features, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering to improve model performance  
- Model training with classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
- Predict churn probability for new/unseen data
